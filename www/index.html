				<h1> Rob and the chocolate bar </h1>
				<h6>By: Thanusan Maheswaran</h6>

			</section>

			<section>
				It was one Sunny day in Havana City, and there was kid name Rob and he was only 5. Rob loved shopping with his mother
        at the local groceries story. Everytime Rob goes shopping with his mother, he always takes a chocolate bar without paying
        and he thought no one ever saw him.
        </section>

			<section>
				But, the 5th time he when shopping with his mother, the cashier saw Rob taking the chocolate bar and puting into his pants
        pocket. The cashier then told the mother and Rob was scared of what his mother would of think of him and what she would do
        to him at home. His mother explained to him stealing was bad and he could go to jail and not see his parents again.
			</section>

			<section>
			But ever since that day Rob never stole another chocolate bar and the next time he when he saw someone doing it and told his
      mother.
			</section>

			<section>
				Moral of the story is that you should never steal and if u never get caught, you will one day or bad karmma will get to you.
